# SublimeLimes_basicMatplotlibDataVis

With this CodeCademy project, I use matplotlib to help a fictional lime company gain insight to their customers' purchasing habits by using styled line graphs. 

By creating two organized and clearly labeled tables, the company is able to see possible correlations between the monthly number of visits to the webpage and the total lime sales of the three different kinds of limes.
